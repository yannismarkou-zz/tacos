TACOS stands for Text Analyser of Crowdsourced Online Sources. It is a social relationship search tool that given a search term, analyses user features and discovers authorities and user communities for that term. For knowledge representation, it visualises the output in a graph, for increased readability.

TACOS was presented in the DBKDA 2016 conference. The conference paper can be found [here](https://github.com/yannismarkou/tacos/blob/master/paper/TACOS.pdf "TACOS paper").

The output of the tool is a visualisation of user communities related to a certain topic. The visualisation is created using the Cytoscape avaScript library.
